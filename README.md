Introduction
This repository hosts machine learning models built for predicting diabetes and forecasting the sales of boom bikes. The diabetes prediction models aim to identify the likelihood of diabetes based on medical data, while the sales prediction model forecasts the number of bikes sold based on historical sales data.

Models
Diabetes Prediction Models
Model 1: Logistic Regression
A logistic regression model trained to classify the presence of diabetes.
Model 2: Random Forest Classifier
A random forest classifier for predicting diabetes, providing more robustness and accuracy.
Sales Prediction Model
Model: Linear Regression
A linear regression model designed to predict the sales of boom bikes based on various features like weather conditions, promotional activities, and seasonal factors.
Datasets
Diabetes Prediction: The dataset includes medical data such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.
Sales Prediction: The dataset includes historical sales data of boom bikes along with features like date, temperature, holiday information, etc.
